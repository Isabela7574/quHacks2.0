        <p>We had a wonderful team work on this amazing project over the last few hours. Our team members include Isabela Magnoni (PHS '25), Zoey Zhang (ERHS '26), Gabrielle Sutherland (CCBC '25), and Jackie Gao (CHS '26). This project was made for QuHacks 2025 and is very cool.</p>
        <p>We would like to give special thanks to our moms for making us so that we could write code. We would also like to shout out our really cool Computer Science mentors over the years including but not limited to Ms. Bailey, Charlotte Avery, Ro, Dr. Paniagua, ChatGPT, and Emily.</p>
        <p>Also thanks to Sebastian and the rest of SnackUnderflow for hyping us up in these desperate times. </p>
